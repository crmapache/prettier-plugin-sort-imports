# Changelog

## 2.0.0

### Breaking

- **Side-effect imports are no longer moved.** `import './styles.css'`, `import 'reflect-metadata'` and `import './setup/dayjs'` exist only to run code, so where they sit decides which stylesheet wins the cascade and whether a setup module runs before its dependants. Nothing in the import itself says which of the two it is, so the plugin now leaves them alone: they act as boundaries, and the imports around them are sorted in the runs they define. This is what `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` and `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` do, and for the same reason.

  Previously a bare package import was hoisted to a `polyfill` group at the top while anything relative, aliased or asset-like was sunk to a `side-effect` group at the bottom. That guess was wrong in both directions. `import './common/setup/dayjs'` ended up below `./app.module`, so the library was used before it was configured, and a library stylesheet ended up below the components that override it. Both are silent: the code still compiles, still passes tests, and only shows up in the browser or in production.

  Upgrading moves nothing that 1.x had already placed, so a formatted repository stays formatted. Files not yet touched by 1.x keep their side-effect imports where the author wrote them.

- **The `polyfill` and `side-effect` group ids are gone.** Side-effect imports belong to no group now. Listing either id in `sortImportsGroups` is ignored rather than an error, so existing configuration keeps working.

### Fixed

- **A package scope is no longer split across two groups.** With the NestJS preset, `@nestjs/common` was pinned into the library group while `@nestjs/swagger` and `@nestjs/event-emitter` fell into the scoped group, so controllers ended up with a single import, a blank line, and one more import from the same `@nestjs`. A scope is one family: pinning any package in it now keeps the whole scope with the libraries. The same applies to `@angular` and to any scope you pin yourself.

## 1.2.0

### Fixed

- **A scope is no longer counted as a path level.** `@mui/material` is one package with no subpath, but depth was measured by counting slashes, so it ranked alongside `lodash/debounce` instead of alongside `axios`. Scoped packages were scattered through the middle of the library group as a result. Depth is now measured from the package name: `@mui/material` is depth 1, `@mui/material/styles` and `lodash/debounce` are depth 2. Relative paths still count every slash, which is correct for them.

### Added

- **Scoped packages get their own group**, between the unscoped libraries and your workspace packages. This restores the tidy block that 0.6.x produced by accident - back then every `@`-prefixed specifier was misclassified as an internal alias, which grouped them nicely but broke real alias handling. It is now a deliberate group rather than a side effect of a bug.
- `sortImportsGroupScoped` (default `true`) turns that off, sorting scoped packages among the unscoped ones.

### Changed

- A package pinned via `sortImportsPriorityPackages` stays in the library group even when scoped. Without this, the scoped group would swallow `@nestjs/common` and `@angular/core` and undo the ordering their presets exist to provide.

## 1.1.1

### Fixed

- **`sortImportsRemoveUnused` produced invalid code** when an import had only named bindings and some of them were unused. Rebuilding the clause was anchored on the first name, which sits *after* the opening brace, so the original `{` was left in place and a second one was emitted: `import { { withCost, DEFAULT_LIMIT } from './metrics'`. Prettier then refused to format the file. Imports with a default or namespace binding were unaffected, which is why it went unnoticed.

### Added

- The unused-import path now verifies its own output. Rewriting a clause is the only thing this plugin does that edits a statement rather than moving it, so the result is re-parsed before being returned; if it does not parse, the file is left exactly as it came in. A defect there can no longer do worse than nothing.
- The full invariant corpus is replayed with `sortImportsRemoveUnused` enabled, asserting that the output parses, that no binding is added or altered, that side-effect imports are never removed, and that formatting stays idempotent. The option had never been exercised by those tests, which is how the bug above shipped.

## 1.1.0

### Added

- **Monorepo packages get their own group.** Packages from your own repository are dependencies, so they used to sort next to `react` and `lodash` even though they are your code. They now sit between third-party libraries and the aliases of the package being edited. Membership is detected from a `workspace:` version range, a root `workspaces` field, or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so nothing needs configuring.
- `sortImportsDetectWorkspace` (default `true`) turns that off, restoring the 1.0.0 behaviour.

### Changed

- In a monorepo, imports of your own packages move to the new group. This is a one-time reordering; projects that are not monorepos are unaffected.

### Fixed

- Corrected an inaccurate claim in the 1.0.0 notes. The previous plugin did **not** fail to load on Prettier 3: the legacy `prettier/parser-*` specifiers are still aliased in the 3.x export map and resolve fine. The fallback loader added in 1.0.0 is still worthwhile, since those aliases are legacy, but Prettier 3 was never broken for the old plugin.

## 1.0.0

Renamed from `prettier-plugin-sort-react-imports`. The engine was rewritten on top of a real parser, which fixes a class of bugs the previous line-by-line regex approach could not.

### Breaking

- **Package renamed** to `prettier-plugin-auto-sort-imports`. The old name still installs and works, but is deprecated.
- **Scoped npm packages are libraries again.** Previously, in any project without `paths` in its tsconfig, every `@scope/package` import was treated as an internal alias. `@mui/material`, `@tanstack/react-query` and `@nestjs/common` now sort with the other packages.
- **Aliases come from your tsconfig or jsconfig, whatever their shape.** Prefixes without a leading `@`, such as `~/`, `src/` and `components/`, are recognised now. Previously only `@`-prefixed aliases worked.
- Bare side-effect imports such as `reflect-metadata` now form their own group at the very top instead of sorting among the libraries.
- Node builtins now form their own group above the libraries.
- License changed from ISC to MIT.

### Fixed

- A multiline `import X, { … }` or `import type { … }` as the last import produced invalid code and made prettier fail with a syntax error. This hit the most common React import there is.
- A blank line was inserted inside template literals and block comments that contained a line starting with `import`, silently changing runtime string values.
- `// @sort-imports-ignore` never worked in the published package: the committed build output had not been regenerated since before the feature was added. The build is no longer committed, and `prepublishOnly` now rebuilds and tests.
- The pragma is also recognised after a byte order mark, a shebang, a `'use client'` directive, blank lines and other comments, written without a space, or as a block comment.
- Leading comments such as `// eslint-disable-next-line` stayed behind and reattached to a different import.
- With prettier's default `semi: true`, default, namespace and side-effect imports were not sorted at all.
- `export { x } from '…'` between imports was hoisted above them.
- Parser loading no longer depends on Prettier 2's `prettier/parser-*` paths alone. Those are still aliased in Prettier 3 today, so the old code did work there, but the aliases are legacy and the plugin now resolves `prettier/plugins/*` first and falls back.
- A tsconfig containing comments or trailing commas caused every alias to be silently ignored.
- Priority packages were matched by substring, which promoted `preact`, `next-auth`, `nextra` and `@testing-library/react`.
- A specifier whose name begins with `from`, such as `fromPairs`, corrupted the parsed module path.
- A trailing semicolon ended up as part of the module path.
- Comments inside the braces of an import were deleted.
- The tsconfig was read from the working directory instead of the file's location, so monorepos never found their aliases, and it was re-read from disk for every file.

### Added

- Prettier 3 is now supported explicitly and covered by CI, alongside Prettier 2.3+.
- Plugin options: `sortImportsPreset`, `sortImportsGroups`, `sortImportsPriorityPackages`, `sortImportsAliases`, `sortImportsSpecifierOrder`, `sortImportsSeparator`, `sortImportsRemoveUnused`, `sortImportsIgnorePragma`.
- Framework presets for React, Next.js, NestJS, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte, Angular and plain Node, detected automatically from the nearest `package.json`.
- Optional removal of unused imports, off by default, with safety gates for decorators, declaration files, ambient augmentation and single-file components.
- Support for the `babel-ts`, `babel-flow`, `flow`, `espree`, `meriyah` and `acorn` parsers in addition to `babel` and `typescript`. Vue, Svelte and Astro work through their own prettier plugins.
- Alias discovery understands `extends` chains, JSONC syntax and `baseUrl`.
- A test suite that asserts, for every fixture, that the output parses, that no import or binding is lost or altered, and that formatting is idempotent.
